Coding Club, BITS Pilani | Back-End Web Development | Recruitment Task 2018-19

Welcome to the Official GitHub Repository for Coding Club Recruitments! 

#### Excited? Nervous? Confident? Lite? (wait what!?) Mixed Feelings?

Don't worry, I won't be assigning anything super-duper difficult to you (or, maybe it's a lie! :P).

All I wanna do is, Yes! I want you to play a game.

## Rules of the Game 

These are the golden rules you are expected to follow. I will **NOT** accept any submissions if these guidelines are not followed.

- Fork this Repository to your Github account and Clone it to your local machine.
- Make a new branch in your repository and switch to this branch using command line. (Hint? Ok! Search for `git checkout` and how to use it on google)
- Write a draft, create new stuff, make changes, make it beautiful (and blah blah blah blah, ya ya ya ya) and save these changes locally.
- After finishing your assignment, push back the code to your fork and make a pull request back to this original repository.
- If your pull request is merged, you already know what that means, right? ;)
- Keep working on the assignment after your first pull request (optional) and if you want, open another pull request to further improve your submission. 
- Play the game yourself, it's not a multiplayer game. :P

## Let's Play!

Welcome again! Before we start, let me tell you a secret (just kidding!). I really appreciate it when I get things done before the deadline. ;)

Alrighty then, to win this game, you will be building **CC-Zone WebApp** (of course, we are doing web development :P) with the following functionalities:

- Before User Authentication:
  - `Home Page` User Authentication: SignIn via BITS University Email.
  - (Bonus): Add a Navigation Bar with the items being `CC-Zone Logo` of CC-Zone at the left and `Home` next to it.
  
- After User Authentication:
  - Items displayed on the navbar should change to `CC-Zone Logo`, `Home` on the left side and `User Profile` on the right.
  - `Home Page` should display a Feed with Posts listed in reverse chronological order. (Not the same login page again)
  - Include a NEW POST/ COMPOSE button on the `Home Page` to add new posts.
  - `Home Page`: For each post in the feed, include:
    - Author Name
    - Post Content
    - Like button functionality
    - comment functionality
    - (Bonus) Author Image
    - (Bonus) Ability to delete posts and comments
  - `User Profile`: A page displaying general information like username, image, recent posts, total number of posts etc. 
    - Add a Logout button
    - (Bonus) After authentication, instead of `User Profile`, the username should be displayed on the right side of navbar. (for instance, `abhishekspeer` will be displayed instead of `User Profile` if the username is `abhishekspeer`)
    
- [Optional] Make it Beautiful! (just like you) : Use your frontend skills, if you have any, to make it look better.

## Conclusion

At the time (5:30 AM already! Phew!) I'm writing this, I want to share with all of you, the most important rule of this game. The most important rule of this game (or any game) is to **Never Give Up!** 

So, just in case you are not selected (just in case dear! just in case!) **Don't Give Up! Ever!** Follow your passion, keep doing what you want to do. 

(Sounds good, but what if I'm stuck at some point?) 
Don't worry, we are always here to help you out. It's not necessary to be a part of **Coding Club** for that :)

### Good Luck!
